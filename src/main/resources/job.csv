At Silverfin, we're an equal opportunity employer and value diversity at our company. Although we know we’re not perfect yet, we are working hard on it and always open for your feedback.

According to our vision to build a diverse, equitable and inclusive organisation, our policy is to only make a final hiring decision if underrepresented groups are sufficiently represented in the list of candidates applying for the position. For this reason it’s possible interviews get slightly delayed until we’ve reached that goal.

We're committed to elevating talent by creating an environment where we can all thrive together. So if you think you have what it takes, but don't necessarily check every single box, please consider applying. We'd love to hear how you might contribute to our mission and our team.
What can we offer you?
Actual, proper work-life balance
A salary range of €99.000 - €134.000 a year
Flexible working hours and work 100% remotely
Join a distributed remote-first engineering team with 35 colleagues in 14 different countries on two continents
A refreshing work environment with professional, friendly and welcoming colleagues
What will you work on?
You'll help out our existing teams while they're working on a big customer project
This can span from helping with setting up an integration with an external system to helping with internal billing
The project is going to last 6 months
What are we looking for?
You’re experienced in both Ruby and Rails, and also understand where the boundaries lie between them.
You can code in Ruby without any of Rails’ training wheels if necessary.
You have some experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough.
You can communicate clearly in English, both in writing and verbally.
You can start soon - our project is ramping up, so we can use your help as soon as possible.
You know and can apply best practices when relevant. That means the usual like version control, testing, and refactoring; but also higher level concepts such as good object oriented design.
You're aware of the trade-offs involved in proper engineering and can make balanced business decisions, keeping in mind all the stakeholders of the project.

If you’re any good at Ruby, this is probably not the first job ad you’ve seen, so we’ve done our best to stand out while also accurately presenting what we’re all about. If it sounds like you would enjoy working with us, don’t hesitate to apply or drop us a line with questions on engineering-jobs@silverfin.com, or read on for the more detailed explanation ..

What’s a Silverfin?
At Silverfin we’re trying to apply the promise of software to the age-old industry of accounting. With our SaaS we’re automating a large chunk of the busy-work that accountants are currently handling manually, and are building new tools so they can provide better services to their customers. We aim to optimise their workflow in such a way that accountants can spend more time on the much more impactful and rewarding work of advising their customers, the business owners.

The good news is we’re succeeding in doing exactly that. Every week more than 15.000 financial service professionals use Silverfin to help and advise more than 400.000 businesses. Our customers adore us! The even better news is there’s still plenty left to work on, and that’s where we hope you come in.

Since November 2023 we are proudly part of Visma - the European leader in mission-critical cloud software, enjoying the power of the Visma brand and resources whilst retaining business autonomy and go-to-market freedom.

What does working at Silverfin look like?
We work in nimble teams around 5 people in size, with each team taking ownership of a specific set of features of the application. Teams are responsible for a full slice across the stack, so both the backend as well as the frontend of each part is maintained by the same people. Three of our teams are set up as cross-functional product teams, working very closely with product manager and product designer, to understand the users and deliver the best value. Next to the product teams, there are four more platformy teams, who own complex subsystems, like syncs or AI, and / or support the product teams with knowledge, frameworks and services.

Our ops team ensures things run smoothly, deploys happen correctly, and will work with you when issues should arise. We’re enthusiastic followers of the devops mindset, which means ops and developers work together to solve problems, and empower each-other to be self-sufficient, instead of throwing problems over the wall to the “other side”.

We run an up-to-date Rails monolith on the backend, with PostgreSQL and Redis for persistence and caching, and everything is running on a Kubernetes cluster in Google Cloud. Our daily tools include GitLab, Quip and Slack, with Google Meet as our remote conferencing tool of choice.

No code gets deployed without a code-review by a peer and testing is a must. Our pipeline automates deployment when the suite is green, and deploys happen dozens of times a day. Each team is currently doing Kanban, but they’re free to follow whatever process suits them best. There are regular retros held to work towards continuous improvement.

Software for accountants is not considered to be very exciting, but we have our fair share of technical challenges. To give you a sense of scale: our database exceeds 10TB*, and our largest table has crossed the 10 billion row mark a long while back. We interface with more than 30 different external APIs, and provide third parties an API of our own.

: Our ops team noted that this actually isn’t that hard to achieve if you’re just indexing everything, but it still sounds impressive, right?

What makes the engineering team at Silverfin special?
We’re a remote-first engineering team of 35 people distributed in 14 different countries over two continents. A priority for us is maintaining proper work-life balance. We avoid meetings as much as possible, accept deadlines only when absolutely necessary, and never expect anyone to work longer hours than they’ve signed up for. A day in our working lives is pretty boring, and we feel that’s exactly how it should be.

Working with us means you can be flexible with your schedule. It’s OK to disappear for a few hours in the middle of the day to run some errands, get a haircut, pick up the kids - whatever reason, you don’t need to explain yourself.

Being remote-first means we favour asynchronous communication. We don’t shy away from chatting in Slack, but the important decisions or discussions are done in Gitlab issues, over email, or in Quip, so there’s a written, persisted record. We’re mindful of maintaining long chunks of focussed time, which means we avoid @-mentions or PMs on Slack, and other triggers and interrupts. We encourage using Slack’s DnD function, especially when you’re not working!
Requirements
You have at least 5 years of experience working with Ruby, or 3 years of experience with Ruby and 4 years in one or more other programming languages
You get Rails
Your work hours have some overlap with EU business hours (we require your local timezone to be within CET +/- 3h)
You can communicate clearly in English, both written and verbally
Nice to haves
Experience as a remote worker in a fully remote team
Experience working with large datasets and the problems they bring
You have some experience using Javascript framework(s), understand the value of them, but also know when plain Javascript is enough
Experience in Fintech
Accounting knowledge
These would be nice but are definitely not necessary. Don’t worry if none of the above applies to you.
Interested?

You can apply today and we’ll start having interviews from 05/08/2024. There’s no benefit to applying early, so you can take your time answering the application questions.

Nearly every internet connection around the world touches Cisco. We’re the Internet’s optimists. Our technology makes sure the data traveling at light speed across connections does so securely, yet it’s not what we make but what we make happen which marks us out. We’re helping those who work in the health service to connect with patients and each other; schools, colleges, and universities to teach in even the most challenging of times. We’re helping businesses of all shapes and sizes to connect with their employees and customers in new ways, providing people with access to the digital skills they need and connecting the most remote parts of the world – whether through 5G, or otherwise.

We tackle whatever challenges come our way. We have each other’s backs, we recognize our accomplishments, and we grow together. We celebrate and support one another – from big and small things in life to big career moments. And giving back is in our DNA (we get 10 days off each year to do just that).

We know that powering an inclusive future starts with us. Because without diversity and a dedication to equality, there is no moving forward. Our 30 Inclusive Communities, that bring people together around commonalities or passions, are leading the way. Together we’re committed to learning, listening, caring for our communities, whilst supporting the most vulnerable with a collective effort to make this world a better place either with technology, or through our actions.

So, you have colorful hair? Don’t care. Tattoos? Show off your ink. Like polka dots? That’s cool. Pop culture geek? Many of us are. Passion for technology and world changing? Be you, with us! #WeAreCisco

San Francisco, CA

On-site

Being an engineer at a company smaller than 10 people is special. You’ll have a ton of autonomy, be expected to own and build a significant part of the product, and design the product’s growth for the next set of engineers who will be joining us. You’ll wear many hats: developer, designer, product owner, mentor, architect, support engineer, and sales engineer. Our engineers are strongly opinionated people who want to continuously improve the product they’re working on, the team they’re in, the company they’re working at, and the world around them.

Much of our product is still being discovered, but the need is very apparent through tens of conversations with heads of engineering, posts on Twitter and LinkedIn, and the fact that we have a good number of companies who want to sign up as design partners. There’s not much out there about us yet, but we are well funded by investors like Andreessen Horowitz and Boldstart Capital. I’ll share more once we meet.

Our system is a real-time stream-processing application built on top of Apache Flink, running on Kubernetes in AWS. The user-facing application’s backend is a Java-based web application built on top of Dropwizard running on Kubernetes, that manages all the streaming pipelines on behalf of the user, translating their intents into complex streaming Flink pipelines, and delivering our awesome sauce. The role would be to own this backend, deliver clear and intuitive RESTful APIs and ensure their uptime and scalability. Experience with distributed systems, modern Java web applications and RESTful APIs for end users and front-end development are important.

The ideal candidate cares deeply about the user experience and wants to work closely with customers and front-end developers to deliver an excellent user experience. They have experience with building large scale data and analytical applications and have previously worked with and built applications using stream processors. It would be great if they’ve been at an early stage startup before and understand the type of environment it is and are comfortable with its rapidly evolving nature.

Engineering Culture

I believe very strongly that engineering teams work best when everyone is an equally motivated strong contributor to the team, and when egos are dropped and communication and feedback are open and constant. Our motto is “team over self”. We like to look back at our successes and failures and always try to do better. Our goal is to work smarter, not harder. We believe being physically together is the best way to build new systems that are rapidly evolving and to mentor and onboard new team members. That’s why we’re on-site at our office at 3043 Mission St, San Francisco, CA at least 4 days a week.

Benefits

Competitive salary and significant equity as one of the first few people on the team.

Flexible PTO: we really want you to take some time off!

100% paid healthcare coverage for employees and 80% coverage for their dependents

Ultimately, a company is the people that form it, and we want to build a place where people will do the best work of their lives. You’ll have a huge impact in helping us figure out all the right pieces to make it an amazing place to work. I hope that makes it as exciting for you as it does for me.

Grepr provides equal employment opportunities (EEO) to all employees and applicants for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, national origin, age, disability, genetics, sexual orientation, gender identity, or gender expression. We are committed to a diverse and inclusive workforce and welcome people from all backgrounds, experiences, perspectives, and abilities.

About Us

Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.

U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.

U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

The problem: Every minute matters in fire response. As climate change amplifies the intensity of wildfires—with longer fire seasons, dryer fuels, and faster winds—new ignitions spread faster and put more communities at risk. Today, most wildfires are detected by bystanders and reported via 911, meaning it can take hours to detect a fire, verify its exact location and size, and dispatch first responders. Fire authorities need a faster way to detect, confirm, and pinpoint fires so that they can quickly respond—preventing small flare-ups from becoming devastating infernos.

About Pano: Pano is a venture-backed early-stage climate tech startup that is the leader in wildfire early detection, leveraging the latest advancements in IoT, AI, satellites, and SaaS software to deliver actionable intelligence to customers. Pano leverages mountaintop cameras and satellites to detect the first traces of smoke and put real-time fire images in the hands of asset owners and first responders to speed up containment. Pano is already partnering with major utilities, fire authorities, and government agencies in the USA and Australia. Recent media coverage includes being named one of the Top 10 most innovative companies in AI of 2023 by FastCompany and recipient of the Innovative Mobile Service and Application Award at Mobile World Congress through our partnership with T-Mobile.

Pano brings together a diverse team bridging frontline, wildland firefighting experience with best-in-class know-how in operations, logistics, artificial intelligence, and software. Our team is composed of experienced technology professionals from companies such as Apple, Cisco, Nest, DoorDash and Meta. Headquartered in San Francisco with an office and factory in the Mission District, our hybrid team works from locations around the world. Founded in mid-2020, we’ve raised over $40M from leading VC funds.

The Role



The Senior Backend Software Engineer will develop the backend infrastructure for the core Pano application that enables customers to view cameras, investigate smoke, and respond to fires. You'll be part of a team that's developing novel software solutions to enable real-world handling of a key environmental challenge. As a self-motivated and enthusiastic member of our team, you will work in an agile environment and balance developing critical new features with improving the core technical underpinnings of our system.
What you'll do:
Develop web backend service in Java for Pano’s software that will scale as the company grows, be supportable, and be extensible
Design and implement REST API and Multi-threaded Image Processing Pipeline
Work with partners to build core product features meeting security, privacy, and business requirements (e.g. ISO 27001)
Work through the phases of the software development process, including design, implementation, testing, deployment and maintenance
Collaborate with product management, engineering, and quality teams to develop innovative solutions
What you'll bring
7+ years of object-oriented software experience plus a BS in Computer Science or equivalent
5+ years of hands-on Java development experience.
Experience working with cloud service providers

Preferred Qualifications
Experience with Google Cloud
Experience with containerization including Kubernetes
Experience with REST APIs in Java and JAX-RS
Experience with databases including PostgreSQL
Excellent communication skills
Final salary offered is based upon multiple factors including individual job-related qualifications, education, experience, knowledge, skills, and location. In addition to salary, this position is also eligible for stock options. We offer comprehensive health insurance, paid time off and 401k.

Pano is an equal opportunity employer committed to recruiting and supporting our team-members regardless of where they come from.

To manage single-family rentals at our scale, we write lots of software that runs our operations. For this dev pod, our users are hundreds of employees and vendors located in 40+ markets who renovate homes, repair issues for residents, and prepare our vacant homes for the next move-in.

In this role, you will:

Design and build out new features in their entirety that increase productivity. Our particular team builds resource allocation and optimization tools that create industry-leading operating leverage. Our systems orchestrate and dispatch thousands of work orders/tasks every week to hundreds of people across the US.

Scope and prioritize the roadmap. We are constantly shipping, and evaluating new problems/opportunities to improve how our teams work. We talk to our users regularly and ship fast. Engineers help define our long-term tech vision and make tradeoffs between effort and impact so we stay focused on the most important, urgent work at all times.

Analyze efficiency and performance. We're dedicated to continuous improvement and optimization. You'll use data to monitor how our software is performing and identify opportunities that drive business results and improve system reliability.

Your Stats

You'll be working across multiple mobile and web projects. You might be a great fit if these attributes describe you...

"788","feab28b8bbafbfe7","OurFamilyWizard is a technology company on a mission to help families thrive across all of life's circumstances. We bring together three leading family management brands: OurFamilyWizard, (https://www.ourfamilywizard.com/) the world's most trusted co-parenting application, and Cozi (https://www.cozi.com/), the #1 family organizing app in the U.S, and FamilyWall (https://www.familywall.com/index.html), the leading European-based family organization app.

Cozi is the leading family calendar and organizing app in the United States, helping millions of families manage busy family life and receiving over 250,000 5-star ratings. OurFamilyWizard is a SaaS technology platform that enables families to co-parent seamlessly across households. Nearly one million parents and family law practitioners have leveraged OurFamilyWizard to coordinate schedules, record documentation, exchange digital payments, and settle disputes. FamilyWall is available in 9 languages and serves families with their free and paid daily organization, planning, communication and budgeting tools. Together, the platforms provide a holistic set of solutions for all types of families.

We recently received a private investment round from Spectrum Equity, putting Cozi and OurFamilyWizard in the same neighborhood as Grubhub, Ancestry.com, Headspace, and others. We are looking for passionate team members to join us in accelerating our growth to the next level by reaching the millions of families who can benefit from our technology solutions.

As a Software Engineer (Backend), you will directly contribute to features that make everyday life a little bit easier for families on their co-parenting journey. You will be part of an OurFamilyWizard product team, and operate alongside a collaborative group of product managers, designers, QA analysts, automation engineers, and other web and mobile engineers working together to solve meaningful problems for parents, children, and practitioners. We are looking for an individual who is experienced in creating high quality software and has a deep knowledge of Relational Databases, Hibernate, and the Spring Framework. In addition, we value individuals familiar with microservices architecture who are passionate about solving problems.

What you will accomplish:

Getting to know teammates, technology, and tactics.

The first day will be spent partnering with your manager and a teammate to get your local environment set up and fixing a bug. The following 29 days will involve connecting with teammates across OurFamilyWizard and Cozi to gain a high-level understanding of how we prioritize, plan, build, and deliver value to families on our platform. You will build deeper connections with product and platform teammates as you get more immersed in the daily and weekly agile rituals, and the API guild. In these early days, your manager will set up recurring 1:1's and begin the ongoing discussion of personal and team goals. Technical work will focus on gaining exposure to services within your team's domain, as well as key areas of the platform beyond team boundaries where ownership is shared. By the end of your first month, you will be acclimated to the operating rhythm and rituals of your product team and gain confidence by taking on increasingly complex tasks.

Try, learn, ship.

By day 60, you will be comfortable operating within our SDLC from planning through production releases. You will have a broad understanding of our backend architecture, and a deeper understanding of the services within your team's area of ownership and the API's that power our client experiences. Through weekly work that presents complex and varied challenges, you will continue becoming familiar with processes, patterns, and best practices. By releasing regularly, you will have an impact on end users.

Solidifying the foundation.

Beyond the first couple of months, you will grow into an autonomous operator, capable of partnering with API teammates to architect solutions to complex problems that are consistent with our existing patterns and best practices. You will partner with cross-functional engineering teammates, as well as your product manager, designer, and engineering manager to help build execution plans to deliver new features that support our product and business strategy.

Accelerate growth.

Beyond the first 90 days you'll partner with your engineering manager and backend teammates to continue to develop a foundational understanding of platform architecture, design patterns, and best practices. You will have opportunities to inform and affect change at the platform level to further your ownership, impact, and growth. Through partnership with product and design you will be empowered to influence strategy and end-user experience and impact. Complex product problems, and technical challenges related to scale and modernization will continue to keep you challenged, learning, and growing as an engineer.

Who you are:

Confident craftsperson. You have the tools you need to solve most problems, are comfortable speaking to multiple approaches, and have an opinion on the best approach given the constraints.
Scientific artist, artistic scientist. You understand that software is necessarily complex, and are capable of driving clarity in the face of complexity while valuing simplicity as the ultimate sophistication.
Curious operator. You value the variance in challenges a cross-functional team encounters and embrace unexpected hurdles with a mindset that seeks to understand the landscape before charting a course towards a solution.
Pragmatic optimizer. You identify when something's harder than it should be, articulate why change is needed, and affect change through incremental improvements towards an audacious end goal.
Champion of Inclusion. You want everyone on the team to have a voice and are open and eager to hear everyone's thoughts, helping to guide the team to good solutions.
Low ego, high integrity. You value doing what's right over being right. You pivot when a better path forward arises in order to meet technical and business needs and are comfortable saying something when a course correction is needed.

What you bring:

3+ years of Java development experience
Analytical mindset and good problem-solving skills.
Experience in the Spring Framework
Proven experience delivering software applications/features from inception to shipping within a cross-functional team environment.
Object Oriented analysis and design using common design patterns.
Excellent knowledge of Relational Databases and ORM technologies (Spring Boot, Hibernate)

What would be great to have:

Experience with Kotlin
Experience with Docker
Experience with Kubernetes
Experience with Atlassian products for CI/CD (Bamboo, Bitbucket)
Experience with Confluent Cloud (Kafka)
Experience with writing and maintaining tests
Experience with iterative, agile based software delivery processes.
Experience in legal technology or legal profession in some way

Why Join?

Great mission. Creating a safe and productive environment for families to co-exist is extremely important for us; we've been doing it for 20 years and are deeply motivated by adding value to the lives of parents, children, and practitioners.

Growing team. While we've been around for a while, we continue to evolve and innovate. That's what keeps us going! You'll have an opportunity to contribute meaningfully to our organization as we hit our second stride.

Amazing Culture. OurFamilyWizard has a positive and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together, we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative.

Are you looking to accelerate your career growth by joining an early-stage company going after a massive market opportunity?

Visor is a fast-growing company simplifying how people work together. Our vision is to become everyone's favorite place to collaborate on data from anywhere. Visor's product looks like a spreadsheet so everyone knows how to use it. But it's the world's most deeply connected spreadsheet, making entirely new solutions possible.

The company was founded at Harvard. We're backed by the same investors as Airbnb, Shopify, Zapier, Hubspot, and Warby Parker. We have thousands of users worldwide.

We have raised funding (both announced and unannounced) and have plenty of runway. We don't have plans to fundraise for 2+ years.

The role:

We are looking for an experienced software engineer who loves building products. As part of the founding team, you will work alongside the CEO and collaborate daily with the product and design teams. You will be asked to think and act like a founder, and you will be treated as an owner.

Within the first month, you'll start shipping production-quality code. By month three, you will be adding new logging and infrastructure reporting systems. By month six, you'll be adding new features. And by month nine, you'll be spearheading architectural decisions on new integrations.

Given the complexity of building a spreadsheet that works flawlessly with live-syncing external data, we have to keep the foundation rock solid. You will be a foundational part of our long-term strategizing and expected to plan our architecture three chess moves ahead of where we are today.

Who you are:

You have a Bachelors in Computer Science (preferred) or other relevant credentials that demonstrate deep understanding of data structures, algorithms, and programming patterns
You're an seasoned engineer who has 5+ years of experience building backend architecture using Python and Django
You have advanced expertise with AWS ElasticBeanstalk, Django, PostgreSQL, Celery, and Redis
You have Javascript experience and a deep command of the contemporary Python language — more knowledgeable than most
A self-motivated learner who loves improving your skills and knowledge
A collaborative engineer who prioritizes the total output of the whole team over personal achievement
You're willing to recommend improvements to the company's existing practices but open to accept and embrace the architectural decisions and technologies already used
You're deeply interested in product quality, performance, and reliability (not just building new things)
Detail-oriented. To prove it, please include a sentence in your cover letter referencing this line and include this word: meticulous.

What you'll be doing:

Design and build back-end architecture for the core platform (Python, Django)
Gradually assume some engineering leadership responsibilities, including priority-setting, leading our process, and making major architecture and technology decisions
Collaborate with our Principal engineer to design robust, scalable APIs, systems, and architecture
Identify and resolve QA issues across the product
Own and advocate for the health and quality of the systems the team builds
Document your work and our architecture for improved collaboration

Salary range:

We believe in providing transparency into our pay plans to help eliminate the salary gap. The following describes our expected compensation range for this position. In these annual figures, we include the value of the employee's regular salary and discretionary bonuses. We do not include other parts of the company's compensation package, including: equity & options, benefits such as healthcare, unlimited PTO, and budgets for travel & equipment.

Please note that we may be able to extend offers outside of this range in order to match a wider range of candidate experiences and skills. If you are more experienced and have salary expectations higher than this range, please reach out to see if we should continue the conversation.

Primary budgeted range: $150k - $200k

Band 1 - $151k - $175k: This is our main target band for this position. This band is for candidates who are well-established in their career, are very autonomous, have high-cognitive capabilities, and demonstrate deep expertise in engineering.

Please note that discretionary bonuses are subject to the terms and conditions of any bonus plan in effect at that time.

You should note that the company may modify salaries and benefits from time to time as it deems necessary. The company reserves the right to amend or withdraw the discretionary bonus, at its absolute discretion.

Past retreat locations have included East Hampton, the Poconos, and skiing upstate.

More about Hopper

At Hopper, we are on a mission to become the leading travel platform globally – powering Hopper’s mobile app, website and our B2B business, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions). By leveraging massive amounts of data and advanced machine learning algorithms, Hopper combines its world-class travel agency offering with proprietary fintech products to bring transparency, flexibility and savings to travelers globally. We have developed several unique fintech solutions that address everything from pricing volatility to trip disruptions – helping people travel better and save more on their trips.

The Hopper platform serves hundreds of millions of travelers globally and continues to capture market share around the world. Ranked the third largest online travel agency in North America, the Hopper app has been downloaded over 120 million times and has become largely popular among younger travelers – with 70% of its users being Gen Z and millennials.

While everyone knows us as the Gen Z and Millennial travel app, Hopper has evolved to become much more than that. In recent years, we’ve grown into a global travel agency and travel fintech provider that powers some of the world’s largest brands.



Through HTS, our B2B division, the company supercharges its partners’ direct channels by integrating our fintech products on their sites or powering end-to-end travel portals. Today, our partners include leading travel brands like Capital One, Nubank, Air Canada and many more.

Here are just a few stats that demonstrate the company’s recent growth:

Hopper sells billion worth of travel and travel fintech every year. In 2023, over 1.3 billion trips were planned through the Hopper app and our HTS partnerships.

Our fintech products – including Price Freeze, Flexibility for Any Reason and Flight Disruption Assistance – have exceptionally strong CSAT because the terms are always clear, and customers receive instant, no-questions-asked resolutions.

Almost 30% of our app customers purchase at least one fintech product when making a booking; and consumers are 1.6x more likely to repurchase if they add fintech to their booking vs if they booked just travel.

Given the success of its fintech products, Hopper launched a B2B initiative, HTS (Hopper Technology Solutions), which represents more than 50% of the business.

Through HTS, any travel provider (airlines, hotels, banks, travel agencies, etc.) can integrate and seamlessly distribute Hopper’s fintech or travel inventory on their direct channels. As its first HTS partnership, the company partnered with Capital One to co-develop Capital One Travel, a new travel portal designed specifically for cardholders. Other HTS partners include Air Canada, Uber, CommBank, Nubank, Flair Airlines with many more in the pipeline.

Featured in Apple’s Best of the App Store list of Essential Travel Apps in 2023 and recognized by the likes of Fast Company’s Most Innovative Companies, Hopper has been downloaded over 120 million times and continues to have millions of new installs each month. Hopper is now the #3 largest online travel agency in North America and 70% of our app customers are Gen-Z and millennials travelers.

Hopper has raised over $750 million USD of private capital and is backed by some of the largest institutional investors and banks in the world. Hopper is primed to continue its acceleration as the world’s fastest-growing mobile-first travel marketplace.

Be a proficient C#/ASP.NET Core developer with a workable knowledge of building APIs, Razor pages, and some of the core components of ASP.NET Core like dependency injection and middleware.
Be at least pretty good at SQL. You don’t need to be a SQL wizard, but the ability to write pretty good queries and avoid SQL performance anti-patterns is desired.
Be experienced in DevOps, specifically build/delivery pipelines for software. We use Azure DevOps and GitHub Actions.
Have the ability to “right fit” solutions for customers. No ivory towers here – we’re pragmatic in our approach to ensure we’re delivering value.

These things are highly desired:

Proficiency in React and/or React Native, including understanding React state management libraries like MobX and understanding why you would use one over another.
Experience using a testing library like Cypress or Playwright.
Experience with or interest in learning modern machine/AI learning concepts and applications (beyond just using ChatGPT)

These things are useful but not required:

Experience leading small technical teams.
Experience with cloud technologies on a major cloud platform such as AWS/Azure.
Comfortable creating mockups, writing requirements, and generally bridging the gap between engineering and stakeholders.

If you’re looking for words like “minimum years of experience” you won’t find them here. We hire strictly based on the experience you put into your years.

Our benefits include:

Competitive pay
Flexible hours – just need to be available for the customer
Unlimited vacation
Health/vision/dental
Retirement with a company match
A computer of your choice will be provided
Two team retreats each year. If you’re not local to St. Louis, we fly you in, provide you unlimited Ubers, and pay for all your meals. We call it the “white glove” treatment!

We believe work should have meaning and amount to more than a paycheck. For
that reason, we seek out colleagues who share our values and find intrinsic
motivation in doing their best work on a team that is contributing to something

The Company You’ll Join

We are a first-of-its-kind, category-defining software that is revolutionizing the commercial construction industry. Clearstory is digitizing and automating the change order process inside the commercial construction industry. Regardless of what financial software a construction company uses internally, they can use us to share costs with the companies they work with.

Just as TurboTax did for tax documents and Bill.com did for accounts receivable and accounts payable, Clearstory is doing the same for change order communication between construction companies.

The construction industry is being transformed fast by technology, but the way companies communicate costs hasn’t evolved in decades and still heavily relies on carbon copy paper, spreadsheets and email to track billions of dollars. These arcane manual processes can take days or weeks and include hours of manual office tasks such as scanning, manually transcribing, and tedious data-entry into spreadsheets.

At Clearstory we are changing that and creating a new category “change order communication,” by intelligently digitizing this age-old process. This leads to an increase in profits, more successful contractor-to-customer relationships, more transparency into a project’s true cost, and less wasted paper!

We are a Series B 100% SaaS company with impressive credentials for a company at our stage.

The Team You’ll Be Surrounded By

In addition to experienced SaaS sales, marketing, engineering and product leaders, our team has over 60 years of combined experience in the commercial construction space. At Clearstory we know our customer’s pain points and challenges firsthand and have built a category-defining product that serves the user first.

You’ll be part of an ambitious and collaborative company, committed to growing a supportive and diverse team that is passionate about empowering our contractor customers.

More important than meeting 100% of qualifications, we are looking for collaborative, long-term team members with a growth mindset, a commitment to proactive communication, and a bias towards action, who are aligned and excited with our company’s mission to build the industry standard in digital change order communication for the commercial construction industry.

The Opportunity

As an early member of the team, you will have an exceptional level of impact on the development and iteration of our Company and the workplace culture itself.

This is your chance to join a team that is bringing game-changing technology to a stagnant, static, pen-and-paper part of the commercial construction industry.

This is an earlier-stage company and as such you will have many intangible benefits that go along with that opportunity such as the ability to influence the culture of your workplace, the ability to make an immediate impact with a product that already has an established product market fit and a healthy and growing user base as well as significant product influence

Benefits

Ability to work with a new product category that has already found product market fit
Hybrid work schedule
Executive interaction on a regular basis
Competitive market-rate salary for a Series B company
Subsidized healthcare, vision, and dental
Early equity!

We are an equal-opportunity employer and are committed to providing a positive interview experience for every candidate. If accommodations due to a disability or medical condition are needed, connect with us via email at recruiting@clearstory.build. As a company, we value fairness, collaboration, communication, and leadership and build our teams around these values."

Since we opened our doors in 2009, the world of commerce has evolved immensely, and so has Square. After enabling anyone to take payments and never miss a sale, we saw sellers stymied by disparate, outmoded products and tools that wouldn’t work together.

So we expanded into software and started building integrated, omnichannel solutions – to help sellers sell online, manage inventory, offer buy now, pay later functionality through Afterpay, book appointments, engage loyal buyers, and hire and pay staff. Across it all, we’ve embedded financial services tools at the point of sale, so merchants can access a business loan and manage their cash flow in one place. Afterpay furthers our goal to provide omnichannel tools that unlock meaningful value and growth, enabling sellers to capture the next generation shopper, increase order sizes, and compete at a larger scale.

Today, we are a partner to sellers of all sizes – large, enterprise-scale businesses with complex operations, sellers just starting, as well as merchants who began selling with Square and have grown larger over time. As our sellers grow, so do our solutions. There is a massive opportunity in front of us. We’re building a significant, meaningful, and lasting business, and we are helping sellers worldwide do the same.
Job Description

Square Invoices is the easiest way for merchants to close sales and collect payments remotely. Our customers rely on our products because they are well-designed, easy to use, and integrated with their business.

You’ll contribute to the roadmap and strategy decisions and will play a critical role in helping the team accomplish our industry leading growth goals.

On the Invoices Ecosystem team, we focus on supporting advanced workflows for upmarket sellers who tend to have a longer sales lifecycle compared to in person sales. Invoices is unique to Square in that we can flex our products to be used complementary to sellers main point of sale, or serve as a complete business and payments stack solution. Our team is focused, fast-moving, and rapidly growing with an abundance of growth and impact opportunities. We focus on building the best tools to help our merchants close sales and get paid quickly. We are doing this in an efficient and scalable way, by automating critical functions for our merchants.

The DubClub online ecosystem enables sports content creators and sports data providers (collectively termed “cappers”) to make more money with DubClub than anywhere else, while providing a superior experience of information delivery and advantageous interaction for subscribers of cappers.

For cappers: DubClub provides a member buyer network along with a suite of tools, which cappers collectively use to grow their business and reliably deliver their content to their DubClub subscribers.

For subscribers: DubClub offers the fastest content delivery (via push, Telegram, email, Discord) along with communities integrations and “capper discovery” to power a great user experience.

DubClub was founded by a team of Stanford football and baseball alumni who launched the company’s first product in October 2021. Since then, DubClub has scaled rapidly to hundreds of thousands of users (DubClub ""members""), with millions in revenue generated by cappers through the platform. DubClub is backed with Series A funding from a leading Silicon Valley tech VC firm and a leading sports-focused tech VC firm out of New York.

Our Vision is to structurally benefit millions of people through the expertise of our customers (sports cappers).

We will achieve our Mission and Vision by relentlessly delivering growth for our customers.

Dub, verb. Slang for the word “Win”.

Club, noun. An association of people with common interests.

The role

Engineers at DubClub work across our Capper and Subscriber products, third party system integrations, and infrastructure that helps scale the foundation of our highly available systems.

We are hiring for a Senior Engineer to join our early-stage team and take ownership of feature sets and products that support DubClub’s growing online member ecosystem.

Join us in crafting a stable platform that not only ensures the company's success for the long haul but also keeps pace seamlessly with our rapid growth trajectory.

The problems you will solve

Build, design, and implement robust backend solutions utilizing Python/Django framework, ensuring optimal performance and scalability.

Collaborate with Product, Design, and fellow Engineers to translate conceptual requirements into technical specifications and deliver high-quality software products.

Contribute to the development and maintenance of CI/CD pipelines, orchestrating seamless software delivery processes to accelerate product releases and enhance efficiency.

Conduct code reviews to ensure adherence to quality and best practices, coach and mentor team members to raise the bar, and lead by example, actively taking feedback and engaging in development initiatives to elevate standards across the board.

Champion the adoption of emerging technologies/ trends to boost DubClub’s technical capabilities.


What makes a great candidate

Experience with relevant technologies (Python or similar).

Experience working well with Product and Design by building features/products from scratch and/or limited specs, and are able to showcase leadership, ownership, and impact.

Strong communication skills, ability to document and structure ideas, thoughts, and communication into action.

You move fast and are able to execute with a strong bias for impact.

Ideally based in the San Francisco Bay Area (or willing to relocate). We are open to remote on a case by case basis.

Nice to Have:

Passion for sports and familiarity with the sports content industry.

If you want to know more ...

DubClubber Benefits

Impact. Everything you work on drives the business’s growth.

Professional growth and coaching supported. Stipend available for professional development. We promote third party “coaching” for DubClubbers.

Employer contribution and deductible for healthcare coverage.

Work From Home (WFH) stipend up to $1,000 for office equipment.

Laptop available for new DubClubbers.

DubClub is the Destination for Premium Sports Content Creators. Win More Together.

Today, over 3 billion people globally identify as sports fans.

People have been betting on the outcome of sporting events for thousands of years (known as “playing”).

In the United States alone, Americans spend over $100 billion annually betting on sports and 1 in 10 Americans bet on sports every week.

Given the Supreme Court’s 2018 ruling to allow states to legalize sports betting, our industry is nascent and growing.

Most people who bet on sports end up with less money in their betting bankroll over time given the relative sophistication of sportsbooks.

Thus, tens of millions of people are turning to social media seeking capper expertise.

Without DubClub, there is no bespoke network for advantageous sports information and interaction.

As a result, DubClub exists to build an online ecosystem where everyone Wins More Together.

Our Values (The 4 ""C's"")

We are product-centric in our approach to delivering growth for cappers. Our 4 main values are below.

Customer-obsession

Customer Obsessed: Sports cappers are our customers (aka “partners”). Our partners (cappers) are our highest priority and our greatest asset. Subscribers use DubClub because cappers use DubClub. Without cappers, we would have no problems to solve and thus DubClub wouldn't exist.

Pain Solving: Start small, solve pain, ship a simple solution, get feedback (seek the Answers to the Test), and iterate from there. We deliver growth for our partners by solving problems.

Collaboration

Win More Together Positive vibes only. We rely on each other and trust each other. As a remote-first company, we prioritize sharing knowledge through meetings facilitated by written documentation. Collaboration is KEY. Documentation is GOLD.

Accountability: DubClub employees are provided resources to succeed and are valued for holding themselves accountable. Performance is measured and communicated with directness and transparency.

Creativity

Informed Risk Taking: We place educated bets (quite literally using the advice of cappers). We de-risk our big ideas with theses that we can test and data that provides us with a measurable outcome.

Compound Value: We double down on bets that can provide value for our partners (cappers) and our partners’ customers (subscribers).

Clarity

Intentional decision-making: *We make decisions collaboratively, but with intentionality. To avoid extraneous opinions that slow us down, we use the RAPID framework and provide Answers To The Test for components of the RAPID.

Less is more: We eliminate ambiguity and reduce complexity to increase comprehension. This applies to processes, protocols, documentation, code, and more. Clear eyes… full hearts… Win More Together.

Housekeeping: Regular cleanup ensures that we avoid extraneous noise that can slow us down. We strive to be anti-chaos machines.

Why Work With Us at DubClub?

You will have a real impact (quickly!) on real people's lives in a rapidly emerging industry.

We're in a novel industry solving novel problems.

Embrace the freedom to experiment: Have a good idea...? Ask highly engaged partners and subscribers, start small, ship it, get feedback, then iterate. Just make sure you come prepared to share data!

Prioritize professional development: We invest in your zone of excellence, provide coaching, and ensure cross functional exposure/experience.

Work alongside a leadership team that is open to ideas and input, while giving tangible direction on how to make an impact.

Receive regular 360 feedback that is focused on personal development.

Collaborate with other DubClubbers and work hard towards a shared goal! But, know that we don't take ourselves too seriously. Our partners matter more than anything.

Be a valuable member of our fun, remote team! As evidenced by our 10+ food, nature, pets, etc. Slack channels.

We are an equal opportunity employer and do not discriminate on the basis of any status protected under federal, state, or local law."

At Evergrow, we seek to build and sustain a carbon-neutral world. We're fulfilling this mission by making financing accessible for those creating low-carbon infrastructure and technology (e.g., wind, solar, renewable natural gas). The new climate bill passed by Congress in the Summer of 2022 is a game-changer for renewable energy project developers, and we are building solutions to ensure they can take advantage of associated financial benefits.

Yuma is building Autonomous AI Agents dedicated to customer support and e-commerce. We have a fairly advanced platform supporting more than a hundred paying customers. Our agents are powered by knowledge and processes. They take actions and fetch external information from internal apps as needed.

Our top merchants are automating up to 60% of their support tickets through Yuma.

Yuma was founded by Guillaume Luccisano, a 3rd time YC founder.

Role Overview

We are still a small team of 6 engineers, but we are moving quickly! Iteration speed is key. We have built a lot over the past year, but there is still so much to do! We do a mix of iterations, A/B testing, LLM research projects, new feature development, performance work, and more. We are heavily focused on delivering value to our users and are very product-focused. This is the only thing that matters.

Our backend is a standard Ruby on Rails API powered by PostgreSQL, Redis, and Sidekiq jobs. We already have a fair amount of load ingesting and processing millions of support tickets monthly.

About You:

You have led and built multiple large Rails applications, and you always strive for excellence. You are pragmatic, making the right trade-offs that favor speed of iteration while maintaining high product quality. You are driven by delivering the best experience and value to your users. You might have a preference for working on backend projects, but you aren't afraid of frontend work. Rails has no secrets for you.

Recent experience playing with LLMs is a huge plus, and pretty much getting mandatory in 2024 now :) Building with LLM and a non-deterministic output is a very different kind of engineering too!

If you are relentless and looking to join an early, hard-working team, we want you. We are seeking someone who is looking to embrace a new challenge and commit to it 100%.

Your diploma don't matter to us; we only care about your skills.

The Platform API team owns both server-side APIs and client-side libraries across different languages.

Develop secure and scalable key management systems, packaged as Docker images, to enable crypto wallet functionality across a range of custodial configurations (e.g. self-custodial MPC)
Work closely with many different teams at Coinbase to externalize their backend services through the Platform APIs, ensuring consistency of concepts, style, and design
Interface directly with customers to collect their feedback and iteratively improve the Platform APIs and SDKs
Build compelling sample applications end-to-end using the Platform APIs and SDKs to demonstrate their value and pressure-test the developer experience
Troubleshoot and debug complex fullstack issues, ensuring stability, reliability, and security
Participate in code reviews and provide constructive feedback to maintain high code quality standards

About Us

Since 1945, U-Haul has been serving do-it-yourself movers and their households. Like many other successful ventures, the concept for U-Haul was generated out of need. After World War II, there existed the widespread need for do-it-yourself moving equipment that would be available on a one-way, nationwide basis.

U-Haul co-founders L.S. ""Sam"" Shoen and his wife, Anna Mary Carty Shoen, recognized that need and acted upon it. Their visionary approach spread the cost of ownership among many users, facilitating the mobility of the populations of the U.S. and Canada. The covered wagon of the pioneers morphed into orange U-Haul trailers. In the process, an industry was born.

U-Haul Holding Company and its family of companies, including U-Haul, have strived to create a culture of health and wellness. As of February 1, 2020, and consistent with applicable law, no U-Haul Holding Company or its family of companies will hire individuals in states where it may lawfully decline to hire individuals who use nicotine products (Alabama, Alaska, Arizona, Arkansas, Delaware, Florida, Georgia, Hawaii, Idaho, Iowa, Kansas, Maryland, Massachusetts, Michigan, Nebraska, Pennsylvania, Texas, Utah, Vermont, Virginia and Washington).

We build our app using reliable tools that our team knows and trusts, including PHP/Hack, Java, MySQL, and Linux. Expertise in these areas is a huge plus, but having familiarity with other common web languages (such as Python or Ruby) and other relational databases are fine substitutes. We’re a collaborative team who genuinely enjoys working together with a cross-functional team of product managers, designers, frontend, iOS, Android, automation, and quality engineers to make Slack a better product.

We have 8.8M+ app installations with 155,000 weekly active developers building on the platform.

90% of our paid teams on Slack actively use apps.

Slack has a positive, diverse, and supportive culture—we look for people who are curious, inventive, and work to be a little better every single day. In our work together we aim to be smart, humble, hardworking and, above all, collaborative. If this sounds like a good fit for you, why not say hello?

You’ll set the vision for strategic development of methods, techniques, and evaluation criteria for projects and programs across the engineering organization.

You’ll direct and guide the efforts of a pillar or functional group through delegation to senior technical leaders.

You'll proactively identify and remedy communication gaps and issues to reach alignments for complex issues across diverse audience and influence organizational goals and strategy.

Birmingham is geographically diverse and has many outdoor recreation areas nearby like Oak Mountain State Park, Red Mountain Park, and Mt. Cheaha. Being in central Alabama, Birmingham is easy driving to the Gulf Coast, as well as Atlanta, Georgia, and Nashville, Tennessee. We’re known for our food in Birmingham: The local restaurant and bar scene punches way over its weight for the size of the city (Hot & Hot Fish Club, Highlands Bar and Grill and others are nationally acclaimed B’ham restaurants). We also have fifteen craft breweries in the city limits with a wide variety of atmospheres from college-town pub to upscale cocktail bars.

Our public and private schools are good. The cost of living in Birmingham is low (8% lower than the national average) and the strong economy and low unemployment rate, coupled with a low median household price means your money goes a lot farther when it comes to buying a home.

Job Description


Bitkey sits within the Proto team. Proto's purpose is to accelerate the world’s transition to a more open economy by making products that increase access and independence for everyone. The first two initiatives we’ve identified that represent the biggest impact to this purpose are in the Bitcoin space with Bitcoin mining and Bitkey, a self custody Bitcoin wallet.

Maintain a high quality bar for our overall infrastructure by ensuring we have the right visibility into tracing, metrics, logging, and alerting

Iterate on our staging and production infrastructure deployment story

Continue evolving our testing infrastructure in different environments from hardware to mobile to server side for both our own services and the bitcoin network.

Work with Block foundational and security teams to leverage foundational tooling and coordinate cross-BU infrastructure work


Qualifications

Worked with various teams to develop software approaches and aligned partner teams to advance the work

Navigated architectural decisions that weigh trade-offs between building your own solution or buying something that suits your needs

Identified bottlenecks in systems, quantified their impact, and prioritized effectively

"1403","d3893600f1c28892","Who we are:
At Optimize Health, we believe that it's time to rethink brick-and-mortar-only healthcare visits. With our powerful combination of the leading platform technology, patient-friendly devices, and trusted support, we are pioneering how medical groups use technology and real-time data to treat patients' health outside the practice walls. As the most trusted and experienced remote care vendor in the industry, we simplify the complexities of delivering effective, high-quality remote patient monitoring and optimize our clients’ clinical and financial performance.

We are seeking Platform Engineers to help us integrate more partners’ systems with ours, introducing new data to store and exchange, while ensuring the system can continue scaling well with our ever-growing population of users. Today Optimize Health offers a platform for remote care of patients, collecting readings from devices and assisting clinicians in analyzing and acting upon that data, watching over their patients to keep them healthy and happy. Within the medical field, information management still takes place across archipelagos of segregated systems, relying on human toil—and its attendant drudgery and fallibility—to ferry between them. Optimize Health aims to bridge these divides, making it easier and safer for clinicians to offer more integrated care options to their patients—with a service that continues to feel fast and reliable. You can make that happen.



Though we have a few offices in which our clinicians work, our engineers work remotely, spread across the hemispheres but mostly grouped near the Eastern Time Zone. We do travel occasionally to get together in person, if you’re into it.
Our Tech Stack

We have a software system organized along a few well-trod paths, with the “platform” or backend involving the following:
Go
Amazon DynamoDB
AWS Lambda
Amazon Simple Notification Service (SNS)
Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
gRPC
Protocol Buffers
GraphQL

We use a few vendors for important capabilities:
Communications: Twilio
Identity & Authentication: Auth0
Monitoring & Observability: Datadog

For building and deploying, the following are also pertinent:
Bazel
Terraform
GitHub Actions
Amazon Elastic Container Service (ECS)

You don’t need to be an expert in all of these. Being confident with the first few is most helpful, but more important is you being interested in the menu as an opportunity to learn. This is what we’re using today, and any of it could change. If you’re willing to learn and recognize that as your primary responsibility, we’d love to have you.
Your work week will involve:
Consulting with product designers, customer success advocates, and your fellow engineers to decide what to build next.
Writing code to extend and improve the product, refining your work through your colleagues’ review.
Reviewing and writing your own design documents for the bigger things. Writing to inform or convince your audience is useful, but writing as a means of annealing your thoughts for yourself is even better.
Responding to the occasional cry of distress from the system, and tuning the monitoring criteria to adapt to new facts and suspicions.
Observing people using our product, understanding their needs and difficulties, and proposing improvements to close those gaps.
Following and contributing to open-source software projects.
Bumping into things you’ve never heard of and problems you’ve never seen, summoning your courage, and pushing forward with confidence.
We are looking for people who:
Have 2–4 years of experience working with some of the technology we use.
Care deeply about the quality of their work and want to be proud of what they’ve built.
Discover, create, complain, and celebrate out loud, staying in close touch with their coworkers despite the distance.
Can survey the spectrum of solutions from the inadequate to the ideal, choosing what’s appropriate today, mindful of what can come later.
Treat the edges of their knowledge as incidental and malleable, being eager to study something unfamiliar as soon the need arises.
Our Story:
Optimize Health was founded in 2015 with a focus on improving patient outcomes. We simplify effective remote care and reduce the administrative and financial hurdles in order to improve patient outcomes, lower hospitalizations, and reduce patient expenses.

We believe healthcare technology should be designed for the patient and provider. That’s why we created an elegant remote care platform, along with monitoring services, designed to offer the best experience possible for healthcare workers and patients. Created and supported by a world-class technology team, Optimize Health is a market leader in remote care.

We recognize we are trying to solve a really hard problem and that is why those that join our team are so important. “Optimizers” are the core of our company and we strive to continue to be a best place to work that is equitable, fulfilling where team members feel like they belong.

We embrace diversity and are an equal-opportunity employer. All qualified applicants will receive consideration for employment without regard to race, color, religion, sex, sexual orientation, gender identity, national origin, disability, or status as a protected veteran. No matter your background, your orientation, or your identity expression, if you are passionate about modernizing and improving the future of healthcare, we want to hear from you!"

You might be a fit for this role if you...

Have 4+ years of engineering experience

Have experience writing backend services in Go or Typescript

Have experience designing, building, and maintaining robust APIs

Enterprise cybersecurity is broken. Current annual cybersecurity spending is roughly $150B, with most enterprises spending heavily to deploy, manage, and configure 100s of different tools for marginal security benefit. At Zip, our goal is to build software that makes enterprise cybersecurity reasonable – to reduce bloat by bundling and configuring opinionated security tooling, synchronizing everything from device management to application security under one central pane of glass.

Multiple companies with security offerings from Google to Jamf are now releasing APIs that allow automated management, and with new government efforts to publish data on the global security risk landscape, there’s a unique opportunity to be the first in the market to properly integrate and build a full-stack, opinionated, enterprise security company. At Zip, you’ll be at the cutting edge of security, working with some of the world’s most important companies to effortlessly secure their people, software, and data.

Our Values

We want our employees learn, grow, and have career satisfaction

We want to create a successful company – but not at the cost of culture. At Zip, we value each other, and want to create a culture where our people are not only “working in a fast-paced, challenging, environment” but are also (and more importantly) happy, learning, and able to contribute. We value succeeding as a collective.

We are a high autonomy, high trust organization that prioritizes thoughtful communication

No one likes being micromanaged. At Zip, we value autonomy and trust our employees to get the job done. We add communication here to emphasize that high autonomy and high trust doesn’t mean no support. At Zip supporting our employees and creating a great culture is a top priority. Thoughtful communication in tandem with high ownership is key to not just building a successful culture, but also external collaboration with customers and internal teams.

We value transparency, equity, and empathy.

Honest, empathetic feedback is kind. It gives your co-workers the opportunity to grow and become the best versions of themselves. At Zip, we value frequent, well-structured, fair feedback – feedback that directly relates activities to outcomes, and allows us all to move forward together, better.

We want to move fast, be flexible, but not break things:

We’re a start-up: we need to move fast, and be able to pivot at a moment’s notice. But we don’t want to break things, and want to balance being fast with being thoughtful and intentional about how we build our software.

We value balance

Whether it’s work/life balance or moving fast/building right balance, understanding the tradeoffs in a start-up and making sure to strike the right balance is necessary. We continuously evaluate our decisions in a data-driven way, and aim to make sure we’re always getting better.

We assume best intentions

We're a team working together to make enterprise cybersecurity easy. We'll face hard problems together, and assuming best intentions of coworkers is of utmost importance to building a great culture.

The Role

As a Founding Backend Engineer, you'll help build from the ground up, designing and implementing secure APIs that harmonize functionality across multiple different enterprise software providers. You'll build a first-class, multi-tenant, cloud-native product and gain experience with everything from optimizing database queries to constructing secure login. You'll gain experience with:

AWS services (RDS, ECS, Fargate, etc.)

Infrastructure as code (Pulumi, Typescript)

Docker

Rust

Auth0, HashiCorp Vault

Common enterprise security tooling (Jamf/Okta/GSuite/Microsoft Intune/Crowdstrike etc.)

Requirements

Overall, we’re looking for software engineers with high-ownership, autonomy, and willingness to learn.

Preferred requirements are flexible, but are loosely:

Familiarity with AWS services

2+ years of experience as a software engineer

Willingness to learn new things

An interest in security
